# Weather-App: Node.js, Python/Pandas, D3.js, (React.js)

## Description

  *A CLI weather-tool / (app) which fetches a lat/lon coordinates of user-input address (postal codes, zip codes, cities, etc.), from the Google maps API, and uses those coordinates to fetch the past, current, and forecasted weather data from the forecast.io (darksky.net) API (requires an API-key).  Currently, this only functions as a CLI (command-line-interface) tool, where functionality is run by `Node.js` (e.g. `$node app.js -a [address]`) based on the user-input address*.

  *The* ***goal*** *of this project is to ultimately use `React.js` to create the font-end of an on-line app where* ***current***, ***hourly***, *and* ***minutely*** *weather data will be displayed, both visually as time-series figures and as data tables, depending on the input-address from the user.  Visual representation will be presented by using `D3.js`; Back-end will be powered by `Node.js`; Data fetching, parsing, and manipulations will be done so using `Python/Pandas`*.
