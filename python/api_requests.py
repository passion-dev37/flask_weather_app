        When making a request to the 'forecast' URL from DarkSky:
        (API responses consist of a UTF-8-encoded, JSON-formatted object)

        -----

        The returned object (request.models.Response type) has a \'.json()\'
        method, which returns a Python Dict object.

        Calling the .keys() - i.e. 'forecast.json().keys()' method on the dict
        will return the following Keys,

            1. 'flags'
            2. 'offset'
            3. 'hourly'
            4. 'timezone'
            5. longitude
            6. 'daily'
            7. 'latitude'
            8. 'currently'
            9. 'minutely'

        > 'flags':
            - Returns a Python Dict object
            - A flags object containing miscellaneous metadata about the request.
            - Keys,
                - 'sources':
                - 'isd-stations'
                - 'units'

        > 'offset':
            - deprecated (use timezone, instead)

        > 'currently'
            - SINGLE data point containing the current weather conditions
            at the requested location

        > 'minutely'
            - Data block containing weather conditions minute-by-minute for the
            next hour

        > 'hourly'
            - Data block containing the weather conditions day-by-day for the
            next two-days.

        > 'daily'
            - Data block containing the weather conditions day-by-day for the
            next week

        > 'latitude'
            - Requested latitude

        > 'longitude'
            - Requested longitude

        -----

        Some of the values returned for each key will be a 'data block object',

        > Data Block Objects:
            - Represents the various weather phenomena occurring over a period
            of time.
            - These objects contains the following properties:
                - 'data',
                    - Array of data points
                    - Ordered by time
                    - Describes the weather conditions at the requested location
                    (lat,lon) over time
                - 'summary':
                    - Human-readable summary of data block
            - *** CURRENTLY, FOR MVPs' SAKE --> ONLY CONCERNED WITH 'TEMPERATURE' ***

        -----

        This request returns the observed or forecast weather conditions for a
        date in the past or future.

        EXCEPT,

            > 'currently'
                - Data point will refer to the TIME PROVIDED (...instead of current time)

            > 'minutely'
                - Data block will be ommitted...
                - Unless requesting a time WITHIN AN HOUR OF PRESENT

            > 'hourly'
                - Data block will contain data points STARTING AT MIDNIGHT (OF LOCAL TIME)
                of the DAY REQUESTED, and will continue until MIDNIGHT OF THE FOLLOWING
                DAY

                    - For example,
                        - A request is made for day = (t-2); where 't' = present day
                        - 'hourly' data block from the above request will start
                        from,
